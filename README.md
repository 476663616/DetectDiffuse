## Getting Started

#### Installation

###### Requirements

- Linux or macOS with Python ≥ 3.6
- PyTorch ≥ 1.9.0 and [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/) that matches the PyTorch installation.
  You can install them together at [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org) to make sure of this
- OpenCV is optional and needed by demo and visualization
- More requirements can be found in requirements.txt.
- These should install in about 10 mins.

Steps

1. Install Detectron2 following https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/INSTALL.md#installation.
2. Prepare datasets and  link it to detectron2.
3. install Requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Datasets' links:

for the dataset end with "*.nii.gz/*.nii", 
python dataset_process/nii2coco.py

for the other end with "*.nrrd",
python dataset_process/nrrd2coco.py

mkdir -p datasets/trainset

## Train

Please use the config file in configs/diffdet.coco.res50.yaml and customize your parameters!

Train instruction:

```
python train_net_lesion.py --config-file configs/diffdet.coco.res50.yaml
```

Training duration depends on equipment performance and is typically completed within a week.

## Inference

Please modificate the `"MODEL-WEIGHTS"` in congfig to your model path.

Inference instruction:

```
python train_net_lesion.py --config-file configs/diffdet.coco.res50.yaml --eval-only True
```

Training duration depends on equipment performance and is typically completed within several hours.

After inference, a `.pkl` file  and a `.json` file of the result will be generated in the output folder which you set in the config file.

## Visualization and evaluation

`python test.py`

After run the code, the visualization results will generated in the output folder which you set in the code, and the evaluation result will  be printed in the terminal.
